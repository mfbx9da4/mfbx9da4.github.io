title: About me
---

I am a senior full stack web developer with an entreprenurial mindset. I specialize in python, node, javascript, react and SQL. I travelled the world as a digital nomad contracting for premiere financial companies from New York. I have built my own startup as the CTO at [Fube](http://fube.io/). I have built recommendation engines for the ecommerce market in Brazil at [Chaordic](https://www.chaordic.com.br/). During my neuroscience degree I [designed machine learning algorithms](https://github.com/mfbx9da4/neuron-astrocyte-networks) to innovate neural networks based on bleeding edge neurobiology.
