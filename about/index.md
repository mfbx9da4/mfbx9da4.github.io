title: About me
---

Over my career, I have developed many performant scalable web applications (backend and frontend). I pride myself on my code being performant, well tested and
"[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)".
I am an expert in python and javascript.

My orginal interest in code stemmed from an academic background in neuroscience and AI. Thrilled by the creative potential drove me to focus on web development. Above all, I consider myself a product engineer and like to be heavily involved in the conception, innovation and usability of the product.

I am originally from London and have dual nationality British-Brazilian.

Currently in search of remote work using
node/python/angular. Ideally in clean tech, surfing and/or a
product that I believe in.
