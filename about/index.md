title: About me
---

I am a senior full stack web developer with an entreprenurial mindset. I specialize in python, node, javascript, react and SQL. I am currently contracting with two San Francisco based startups. Firstly, a peer to peer CDN and secondly building a booking engine for a chain of hostels. I travelled the world as a digital nomad contracting for premiere financial companies from New York. I have built my own startup as the CTO at [Fube](http://fube.io/). I have built recommendation engines for the ecommerce market in Brazil at [Chaordic](https://www.chaordic.com.br/). During my neuroscience degree at the [University of Manchester](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-manchester) I [designed machine learning algorithms](https://github.com/mfbx9da4/neuron-astrocyte-networks) to innovate neural networks based on bleeding edge neurobiology. I have cycled 2000 miles across europe and competed nationally at slacklining.
