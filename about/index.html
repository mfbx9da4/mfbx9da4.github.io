<h1>About me</h1>

<div class="post">
	<p>
	I am a graduate neuroscientist who fell in love with code. My original interest came from AI and neural networks but I quickly became interested in the web. I have since worked several years as a fullstack developer. My favourite languages are python and javascript.
	</p>

	<p>
	I like coding things that I am the user of.
	</p>

	<p>
	I am originally from London and currently living in <a href="/hi">Lagoa da Conceição, Florianopolis, Brazil</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Currently in search for UK contract work using
	node/python/angular starting in the summer extending to
	remote work.
