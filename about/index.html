<h1>About me</h1>

<div class="post">
	<p>

	Over my career, I have developed many performant scalable web applications (backend and frontend). I pride myself on my code being performant, well tested and "[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)". I am an expert in python and javascript.

	</p><p>

	My orginal interest in code stemmed from an academic background in neuroscience and AI. My creative side drove me to focus on web development. Above all, I consider myself a product engineer and like to be heavily involved in the conception, innovation and usability of the product.

	</p><p>

	I am originally from London and have dual nationality British-Brazilian.

	</p><p>

	Currently in search of remote work using
	node/python/angular. Ideally in clean tech, surfing and/or a
	product that I believe in.
