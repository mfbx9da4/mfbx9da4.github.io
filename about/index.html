<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
I am a graduate neuroscientist who fell in love with code. My favourite languages are python and javascript. I like coding things that I am the user of. I recently left my job to go on a mission to code some of my own ideas and self educate using MOOCs (coursera/udacity).
</p>

<p>
I am originally from London and currently living in Lagoa da Conceição, Florianopolis, Brazil.
</p>

<p>
For the time being, I am only considering fully remote roles or relocating to California.
