<h1>About me</h1>

<div class="post">
	<p>
	I am a graduate neuroscientist who fell in love with code. My original interest came from AI and neural networks but I quickly became interested in the web. I have since worked several years as a fullstack developer. My favourite languages are python and javascript.
	</p>

	<p>
	I like coding things that I am the user of. In June 2015, I left my job to go on a mission for one year to do the following:

	<ul>
		<li>Code at least 1 web/mobile app which generates some income.</li>
		<li>Complete at least 12 MOOCs on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">coursera</a> or <a href="https://www.udacity.com">udacity</a>.</li>
		<li>Contribute to at least 1 big open source project.</li>
		<li>Create at least 1 successful open source project.</li>
		<li>All while travelling South America.</li>
	</ul>

	</p>

	<p>
	I am originally from London and <a href="/hi">currently living in Lagoa da Conceição, Florianopolis, Brazil</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	I am currently only considering fully remote roles or relocating to California.
