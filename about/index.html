<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
I am a graduate neuroscientist who fell in love with code. My original interest came from AI and neural networks but I quickly became interested in the web. I have since worked several years as a fullstack developer. My favourite languages are python and javascript.
</p>

<p>
I like coding things that I am the user of. I recently left my job to go on a mission to code some of my own ideas and self educate using MOOCs (coursera/udacity).
</p>

<p>
I am originally from London and <a href="/hi">currently living in Lagoa da Conceição, Florianopolis, Brazil</a>.
</p>

<p>
I currently only considering fully remote roles or relocating to California.
