Fube is a social music discovery tool I designed and built. A lot of great music is shared on facebook but there is no easy way to listen to it in a playlist or filtered by genre. Fube aggregates songs posted by you and your friends on facebook. It merges the facebook, youtube and freebase APIs. Fube is built on Ruby on Rails and angularjs.

Fube has officially been approved by facebook, has over 300 users and is currently in it's beta phase.
