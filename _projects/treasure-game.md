## What?
A game where the goal is to find the treasure.

## Why?
I found it hard to explain binary search algorithms to non technical people. I invented this game as a tangible way to explain this concept to non programmers.

## How?
Allows user to solve game and has a computer auto solver which uses a binary search algorithm. Built with webpack and integrated with giphy service.
