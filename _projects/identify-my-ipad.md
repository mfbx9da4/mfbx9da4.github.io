## What?
Identifies the possible pseudonyms of any particular iPad model and then suggest compatible top rated iPad accessories.

## Why?
The iPad naming scheme is quite ambiguous and there are many pseudonyms for a particular iPad model. I found it laborious to identify which iPad cases are compatible with my iPad and ended up buying an incompatible case, thus [identifymyipad.com](https://identifymyipad.com).

## How?
This site uses google amp for super fast viewing on mobile. Taking data from official apple support and reading reviews on many cases I compiled the content for the site.
