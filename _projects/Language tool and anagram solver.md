This side project was implemented as a coding challenge for an employer. The challenge was to create something interesting using the words from the dictionary.  

The project aims to help people disambiguate similarly spelt words via two main functions.  

Firstly, it displays the dictionary in a tree format so that you may navigate words with the same prefixes. Upon clicking on a particular word it will fetch the wikipedia page for that particular word.  

Secondly, for each word that you select it also finds all anagrams.  

The project uses python for the word analysis and angular.js on the frontend.  It was used by my girlfriend in some private english lessons that she gave.
