For my final year project I created one of the first ever computational models of a learning neuron-astrocyte network. Contrary to popular belief, neurons are not the only cells in the brain which perform learning and cognitive functions. For decades, artificial intelligence researchers have made computational models of neural networks but failed to acknowledge the role of astrocytes. My work presents a novel model of neuron-astrocyte networks and challenges one of the pioneering neuron-astrocyte network models.
