Automates CSS positioning and sprite cropping using image detection algorithms and HTML5 canvas.

In other words: input a spritesheet and a background image, the algorithm matches the sprite to the background image, outputs a bunch of HTML, CSS and a functioning website.

The algorithm runs in linear time to the number of pixels and optimized front-end build time from 5 hours to 1 minute.
