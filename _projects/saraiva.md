Saraiva required a personalized search with better performance than its current search. Saraiva is the biggest book shop in Brazil with over 20% of the market.   

I implemented the frontend of the search and the autocomplete widget. I also assisted in the backend (python/Flask), infrastructure (linux, docker, ansible, AWS) and elasticsearch queries.  

Our search platform won in an AB test against one of the market leaders of search platforms globally (SLI systems).
