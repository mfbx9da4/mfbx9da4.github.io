Whilst working at Chaordic I was working on the search team. The search product personalizes search results of ecommerce websites to match what the user has clicked or bought in the past. 

Saraiva was one of our clients and is the biggest book shop in Brazil with over 20% of the market and our search receives over 1000 rpm.

I implemented frontend of the search and the autocomplete widget. I also assisted in the backend (python/Flask), infrastructure (linux, docker, ansible, AWS) and elasticsearch queries.

Our search platform won in an AB test against one of the market leaders of search platforms globally (SLI systems).
