## What?
Records user invoked javascript events and replays them at a given speed. This could be used for reproducing user sessions for site analytics or screencasts.

## Why?
I became curious by a [Stack Overflow user’s question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42078213/1376627) to record and replay a user’s behaviour.

## How?
For full details of how this works, see this [answer I posted](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42078213/1376627).
