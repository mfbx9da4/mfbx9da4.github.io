# Things to improve on ubuntu

- Fullscreen switching
- Allow aliasing to any window
- Lightweight launcher with tab completion, something like alfred
- Move window to screen up
- HTML, CSS, js file manager with terminal address bar (maybe as chrome appp)
- Autohide top panel
- Remove unity launcher but keep HUD. Probably easier to implement your own HUD.
- Control how many cores are used

## Lightweight graphical interface
- Maybe qt will allow this with arch linux?
- Core can be C++ but launcher and notification area should be HTML5
- Get rid of file menu, move into small menu button, improve hud to show nav in file menu
- Launcher should support executing commands, usr/bin/


# Things I can actually do
- Change right shift to `esc`
- Config gnome to allow terminator guake
