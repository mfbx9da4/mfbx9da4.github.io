Above all, I consider myself a product engineer and like to be heavily involved in the innovation and usability of the product. I have built many performant scalable web applications over my career (backend and frontend). I ensure my code is performant, well tested and "DRY".

In my last contract role I rewrote the entire database-write microservice of the backend ETL system. The code was not trivial and I was very pleased with the performance and test coverage. The entire system was over 200 times faster post rewrite. Unfortunately this code is proprietary so I cannot share it with you.

However, I have built a bunch of things which are open source and I am proud of here http://mfbx9da4.github.io/projects

1 - I am a product engineer. I am not just a code monkey. I care deeply about the products that I build.
2 - I consider myself a JS expert. JS has appeared as the primary or secondary language in every role throughout my career. 
3 - I love clevertech. I researched your employees and blog deeply.

At Chaordic I worked on integrating our custom search engine of the ecommerce site Saraiva (http://www.saraiva.com.br/). Saraiva was huge challenge for us as they were by far our biggest client at the time (~6K searches per minute) and we were placed in an A/B test competition against their existing search engine and market leaders at the time (SLI systems). For 2 months we worked on optimizing the search through double blinds and profiling, finally defeating

## Why us?

In addition to the reasons I provided in my cover letter there are three further reasons I am applying. 

Firstly, I believe my technical abilities match very strongly with those specified. Specifically angular, javascript and python are the three technologies I have used most in my career. 

Secondly, I like the company image and culture. From using the product, reading the blogs and other research I have the impression that hotjar is a great place to work full of interesting and intelligent employees. I like that the whole company is distributed but comes together for holidays and other meetings. 

Finally, I like the product. I believe hotjar has lots of potential and is well built. I found the product to be useful to me. The technical challenges involved in building hotjar are also interesting to me. I was also particularly impressed by the rapid growth of hotjar and the blog posts on those subjects. Growth hacking is something I would like to learn more about.
