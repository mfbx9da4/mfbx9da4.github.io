I have built many high performance scalable web applications over my career (backend and frontend). I ensure my code is performant, well tested and "DRY".

Above all, I consider myself a product engineer and like to be heavily involved in the innovation and usability of the product.

In my last contract role I rewrote the entire database-write microservice of the backend ETL system. The code was not trivial and I was very pleased with the performance and test coverage. The entire system was over 200 times faster post rewrite. Unfortunately this code is proprietary so I cannot share it with you.

However, I have built a bunch of small things which are open source here http://mfbx9da4.github.io/projects
