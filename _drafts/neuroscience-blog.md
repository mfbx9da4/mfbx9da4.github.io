# The interesting parts of neuroscience

## The basics of how the brain works
- LTP, LTD. Fire together, wire together.
- Visual system.
- Hippocampus functions: spatial, role in conversion of short term to long term.
- Basal ganglia and parkinson's disease.
- Epilepsy.
- Limbic system and general introduction neuroanatomy of the brain.
- Motor system.
- Cerebellum neuroanatomy. parallel fibres, purkunje cells, granule cell layer, pyramidal, granulus.
- Mirror neurons.
- Somatosensory system.
- Miguel Nicolelis: neuroprosthetic control of robotic arm. Connected mice by electrodes.
- Neural networks: backpropagation, unsupervised learning.
- Astrocytes

## Boring parts
- What we know about Alzheimer's and dementia. Why they are not worth studying.
- Neuroinflammation
- Psychology
- Behavioural neuroscience

## Basics (analogy + diagram)
- DNA -> proteins
- Synapses, organization by networks --> electricity, excitability, channels, receptors
- Patterns, paths, reinforcement, networks, organizational loops (basal ganglia, limbic system) and distinct areas (visual cortex, somatosensory cortex), cortical loops (areas of the cortex)
- Synaptic plasticity. Wire together, fire together. Low level detail: glutamate, gaba, dopamine, noradrenaline etc. Glu, AMPA, Ca2+ && depol, NMDA, upregulation through affinity of AMPA, upregulation of AMPA, PSD binding.
