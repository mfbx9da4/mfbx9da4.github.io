# Sublime plugin ideas


- `C+S+M` expands to quotes, brackets, braces, else, if, functions (first inside brackets then out)
- `C+S+J` selects indent block **up to** whitespace
- Copy line without copying indent
- Nav by 10 lines
- Move by whitespace lines
- Syntax coloring when a defined variable is used
- Syntax coloring of global variables
- Toggle visualize scopes of braces and brackets in js
- **Real time:** start by adding websokcet which gets text and sends to server on edit
- Replace but preserve case
- HTML block highlighting
