<h1>Things to improve on ubuntu</h1>

<ul>
<li>Fullscreen switching</li>
<li>Allow aliasing to any window</li>
<li>Lightweight launcher with tab completion, something like alfred</li>
<li>Move window to screen up</li>
<li>HTML, CSS, js file manager with terminal address bar (maybe as chrome appp)</li>
<li>Autohide top panel</li>
<li>Remove unity launcher but keep HUD. Probably easier to implement your own HUD.</li>
<li>Control how many cores are used</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lightweight graphical interface</h2>

<ul>
<li>Maybe qt will allow this with arch linux?</li>
<li>Core can be C++ but launcher and notification area should be HTML5</li>
<li>Get rid of file menu, move into small menu button, improve hud to show nav in file menu</li>
<li>Launcher should support executing commands, usr/bin/</li>
</ul>

<h1>Things I can actually do</h1>

<ul>
<li>Change right shift to <code>esc</code></li>
<li>Config gnome to allow terminator guake</li>
</ul>
